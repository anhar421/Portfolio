# Board Game Inventory and Search Engine 

Boardgaming is a popular hobby with people collecting vast inventories of boardgames for their personal use. The struggle with having a large number of games sometimes comes from trying to decide which game to play. If a database of board games is created, it can then be searched by specific attributes (such as number of people playing or the time alloted for the game). A database can also help keep track of which games you own for personal reference.

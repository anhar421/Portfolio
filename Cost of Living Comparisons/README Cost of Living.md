### Important Insights
Florida's median income is the lowest of the three states and has grown at a slower rate than New York or Washington. The number of households in Florida exceeds both New York and Washington state, although New York has a larger population. Occupation distribution has historically been similar between Florida and New York, although Florida has more variation as production, transportation, and material moving occupations have decreased over time. Washington state's occupation distribution is different and relies heavily on sales and office positions, which likely contributes to Washington state having the highest overall median income.

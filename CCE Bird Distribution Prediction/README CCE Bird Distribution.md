# California Current Ecosystem Bird Species Distribution Analysis and Prediction
## Using observed bird sighting data to predict future species distribution

This project investigates the distribution of bird species along the California Current Ecosystem. It uses historical information of bird sightings along surveying transects to attempt to predict future bird species appearances at specific locations. Multiclass classification models were created using PyCaret.

### Language
Python

### Tools
PowerBI for visualization and some processing

### Data Source
NOAA Fisheries dataset:

### Important Insights
Initial investigation did not reveal significant predictability from the models constructed. Several factors could have played a role in this outcome, including consistent distribution of certain species across the entire surveying area. There were also variables that were not included in the intital dataset that may affect bird sightings, including weather, ocean chemistry, and human interference.

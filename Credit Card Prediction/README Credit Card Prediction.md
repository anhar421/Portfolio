# Credit Card Application Risk Assessment and Prediction

Using financial and demographic information from credit card applications and other sources, credit card companies can attempt to predict future payment behavior using machine learning and data analysis. This project uses customer data from a credit card company's application forms as well as payment history data in regression models using PyCaret.

### Language
Python

### Data Source
Credit Card Approval Prediction datasets from Kaggle

### Important Insights
Regression models using PyCaret did not show high rates of accurate prediction. However, this could be partially attributed to the low number of customers available in the final dataset after cleaning as well as the high variable variation that occurs when attempting to predict human behavior.

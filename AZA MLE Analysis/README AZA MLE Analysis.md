# Association of Zoos and Aquariums Median Life Expectancies and Appearances Analysis
## Comparing Median Life Expectancies of different AZA animals and Appearances in the Wild

This project investigates reported occurrences of specific species of animals in the wild alongside their reported Median Life Expectancies (MLE) in Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredited zoos.

### Language
Python

### Important Insights
This project was an opportunity to utilize different skills such as web scraping, API usage, SQL, and various data wrangling and cleaning techniques. The idea behind combining the different types of data (MLE, endangered status, and sighting occurrences) was that the three areas could potentially be related. Further study could be done with this project to discover if there are any direct, predictive relationships between the variables.

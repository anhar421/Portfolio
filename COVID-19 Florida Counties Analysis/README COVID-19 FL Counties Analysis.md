# Understanding County-Level COVID-19 Data
## Florida Counties Case Study

County-level COVID-19 data has not been researched thoroughly at this point. This is partially due to the inconsistent nature of population ranges and county sizes. This project begins an initial analysis of various COVID-19 data categories (case rates, death rates) and investigates if there are any correlations between population size and COVID-19 spread. This information would be valuable to understand for future pandemics in order for state and county governments to make informed decisions.

### Language
Python

### Tools
PowerBI for visualization and some processing

### Data Source
New York Times compiled county level COVID-19 data

### Important Insights
The assumption by many during this pandemic has been that population size and density have a direct affect on COVID-19 transmission rates. Initial analysis on a county level, when adjusted for population, shows that was not the case in Florida. Some of the highest death rates and infection rates (adjusted for population) were in low population counties. This suggests that there are other factors involved in transmission. Future studies could include variables such as behavior patterns, adherence to mitigation efforts, access to healthcare, and income.

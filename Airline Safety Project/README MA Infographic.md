Providing accurate information to consumers is an important part of building trust for an individual company as well as the overall business domain. Airline safety is an area that comes into question frequently. It is in an airline's best interest to communicate honest information about the safety measures made by the company and the overall data about air travel. Model Airlines has sponsored an infographic to be posted in airports and other public areas to provide quick facts and figures regarding airline safety.
